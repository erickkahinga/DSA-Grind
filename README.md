# DSA-Grind
This is a public repository where I try and explain my thought process to some of the Leetcode / Hackerrank type problems I solve! I hope this helps you understand the world of Data Structures and Algorithms!

# File Organization:
Question will be organized in folders. Folder names will be the associated title of the coding question prefixed with "LC" or "HR" indicating which website it was found on. Each folder will contain a .txt with my personal explaintion and .py with my coding solution

** I could solve the problem using a language that you will more likely see on the job like (Java, C#, C++, etc) but I find solving leetcode style problems with Python is the path of least resistance to an already hard topic.
